# ML-Project- Forest Fire Prediction
It's worth noting that in some cases, controlled or prescribed burns may be used as a management tool in forestry. These intentional fires are carefully planned and supervised to reduce the risk of larger, uncontrolled wildfires by removing excess vegetation and promoting a healthier forest ecosystem. The goals of prescribed burns may include reducing the accumulation of flammable materials, enhancing biodiversity, and restoring or maintaining a natural fire regime.
